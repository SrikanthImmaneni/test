The Task
--------

Fill out the search.css and search.js so that:

- Everything is centered on the page and center aligned to the parent container
- The controls are centered under the image
- Only one image is shown at a time
- Either the Enter key or the Go button makes a request to the Flickr API for the tag in the search box
- Each click of the previous/next button will either move to the appropriate image or loop back through the list

Feel free to add any additional functionality, eye candy, etc.
